## üòå About Me
I'm Johan, a Data Science and Management student who is passionate about working **data, analytics, and web development**. I enjoy coding to develop websites and to transform raw data into applicable and helpful insights. 
- I'm currently contributing to developing **a condominium management application**
- I'm learning Data Warehousing, Advanced Statistics, and more Agile Web Development to develop my skills and knowledge
- Interested in having experience with data analysis & visualization
- Would not mind more experience with backend and frontend development for a website or application
- Learning Artificial Intelligence (AI) and database design

# üñ•Ô∏è Projects
Welcome to my data science portfolio, where I showcase the projects I have been working on in my previous work experiences, as well as projects I have done for fun.

## Web Development Projects
### [University Survival Kit](https://github.com/undergraduateuwa/CITS3403)
Collaborated with a team to create a web application to help new university students locate campus resources like study spots, food places, events, and organizations.
Built using **Flask**, **HTML/CSS**, **JavaScript**, and **SQLite**.  
Features include:
- Registering and logging in functionalities
- Adding and viewing reviews from users
- Messaging other users

### [Go-Condo Dashboard](https://github.com/johanilagan/johanilagan/blob/main/docs/go-condo_dashboard.jfif)
A full-featured condominium management system designed to streamline daily operations for residential properties.

**Features include:**
- Adding and managing units and residents  
- Tracking payment transactions and summaries  
- Logging visitor check-ins and parcel deliveries  
- Handling service requests across departments  

Built with: **React**, **Node.js**, **MongoDB**, and **Mongoose**  
Role-Based Access: Property Admin, Corporate Admin, Developer Team, Security, Maintenance, Residents  

**My Contribution:**  
I helped in developing the frontend of **dashboard page**, which provides a centralized view of key metrics and activity such as recent payments, visitors, parcels, and service requests. I built React components, and focused on responsive UI/UX.

## Data Warehouse Projects
### [Data Analysis and Data Warehouse Case Study](https://github.com/johanilagan/johanilagan/blob/main/docs/Data%20Analysis%20and%20Data%20Warehouse.pdf)
This case study focuses on designing and implementing a data warehouse to support business intelligence and data analysis needs, based on a comprehensive database of crashes and fatalities in Western Australia. The project covers the full lifecycle of data warehousing including schema design, modeling, and data processing.

Key components of the project:
- Designing a robust data warehouse schema tailored to the traffic safety domain.
- Formulating star schema models to optimize query performance and data organization.
- Developing and executing ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) processes to consolidate and prepare crash and fatality data from various sources.
- Writing business queries to extract meaningful insights related to crash patterns, fatality statistics, and risk factors.
- Analyzing data to uncover trends and support strategic road safety planning.

This project highlights the importance of well-structured data warehousing and effective data integration in enabling powerful analytics for public safety.

### [Cypher Queries and Graph Database Modelling Case Study](https://github.com/johanilagan/johanilagan/blob/main/docs/Cypher_Graph-Database.pdf)
This case study demonstrates how graph database technology and the Cypher query language can be leveraged to efficiently solve complex business queries and extract valuable insights from interconnected data. By modeling the business domain as a graph, relationships between entities become explicit and navigable, enabling more intuitive and powerful analysis compared to traditional relational databases. It solves business queries formulated from a database about crashes and fatality incidents in Western Australia.

Key aspects of the project include:
- Designing a graph data model tailored to represent business entities and their relationships.
- Writing Cypher queries to address typical business questions such as pattern detection, network influence, and recommendation.
- Providing real-world examples of use cases where graph analytics can optimize decision-making.

This study highlights the effectiveness of graph database modeling in enhancing data-driven strategies and operational efficiency.
