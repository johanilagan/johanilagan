## 😌 About Me
I'm Johan, a Data Science and Management student who is passionate about working **data, analytics, and web development**. I enjoy coding to develop websites and to transform raw data into applicable and helpful insights. 
- I'm currently contributing to developing **a condominium management application**
- I'm learning Data Warehousing, Advanced Statistics, and more Agile Web Development to develop my skills and knowledge
- Interested in having experience with data analysis & visualization
- Would not mind more experience with backend and frontend development for a website or application
- Learning Artificial Intelligence (AI) and database design

# 🖥️ Projects
Welcome to my data science portfolio, where I showcase the projects I have been working on in my previous work experiences, as well as projects I have done for fun.

## Web Development Projects
### [University Survival Kit](https://github.com/undergraduateuwa/CITS3403)
Collaborated with a team to create a web application to help new university students locate campus resources like study spots, food places, events, and organizations.
Built using **Flask**, **HTML/CSS**, **JavaScript**, and **SQLite**.  
Features include:
- Registering and logging in functionalities
- Adding and viewing reviews from users
- Messaging other users

### [Go-Condo Dashboard](https://github.com/johanilagan/johanilagan/blob/main/docs/go-condo_dashboard.jfif)
A full-featured condominium management system designed to streamline daily operations for residential properties.

**Features include:**
- Adding and managing units and residents  
- Tracking payment transactions and summaries  
- Logging visitor check-ins and parcel deliveries  
- Handling service requests across departments  

Built with: **React**, **Node.js**, **MongoDB**, and **Mongoose**  
Role-Based Access: Property Admin, Corporate Admin, Developer Team, Security, Maintenance, Residents  

**My Contribution:**  
I helped in developing the frontend of **dashboard page**, which provides a centralized view of key metrics and activity such as recent payments, visitors, parcels, and service requests. I built React components, and focused on responsive UI/UX.

## Case Study Projects
### [Data Analysis and Data Warehouse Case Study](https://github.com/johanilagan/crashes-fatalities-data-warehouse)
This case study presents a full-scale data warehouse project focused on analyzing road crashes and fatalities across Australia. The project supports data-driven insights for public safety and road planning, aligning with national initiatives such as Vision Zero. It demonstrates the complete data warehousing lifecycle, from schema design and ETL to business analytics and policy recommendations.

Key components of the project:

- 🧱 Schema & Dimensional Modeling: Designed a star schema to support efficient querying and multidimensional analysis of crash and fatality data.

- ⚙️ ETL Pipeline: Developed and executed an ETL process using Python and PostgreSQL to clean, transform, and load data from the BITRE Road Fatalities Database.

- 📊 Business Queries: Answered complex queries to reveal insights on high-risk demographics, crash conditions, holiday effects, and location-based patterns.

- 📈 Data Visualization: Built interactive charts using Tableau to communicate findings and support stakeholders in road safety planning.

- 🧠 Association Rule Mining: Applied the Apriori algorithm to identify strong crash-related patterns for policy recommendations.

This project showcases how structured data integration and dimensional modeling can enable advanced analytics that inform government strategies and reduce road fatalities nationwide.

### [Cypher Queries and Graph Database Modelling Case Study](https://github.com/johanilagan/johanilagan/blob/main/docs/Cypher_Graph-Database.pdf)
This case study demonstrates how graph database technology and the Cypher query language can be leveraged to efficiently solve complex business queries and extract valuable insights from interconnected data. By modeling the business domain as a graph, relationships between entities become explicit and navigable, enabling more intuitive and powerful analysis compared to traditional relational databases. It solves business queries formulated from a database about crashes and fatality incidents in Western Australia.

Key aspects of the project include:
- Designing a graph data model tailored to represent business entities and their relationships.
- Writing Cypher queries to address typical business questions such as pattern detection, network influence, and recommendation.
- Providing real-world examples of use cases where graph analytics can optimize decision-making.

This study highlights the effectiveness of graph database modeling in enhancing data-driven strategies and operational efficiency.

### [Comparing Demographic Trends in Australia and Canada using Jupyter Notebook](https://github.com/johanilagan/census-education-analysis)
This project explores the potential relationships between Age and Gender with an individual's Highest Education Level using datasets from Australia and Canada. It follows the data science life cycle and is organized into six key sections:

> Section 1: Framing the research question and objectives.

> Section 2: Data Acquisition — Collecting relevant demographic data.

> Section 3: Data Cleaning — Preparing and refining the dataset for analysis.

> Section 4: Data Conversion — Transforming data into suitable formats for modeling.

> Section 5: Plotting and Graphing — Visualizing data trends and relationships.

> Section 6: Presentation of Results — Summarizing insights and documenting findings.

The analysis is conducted using Jupyter Notebook, demonstrating practical application of data science methods to uncover meaningful demographic patterns. It also uses Python -- pandas and csv modules.


### [A Study on the Effect of Maternal Risk Factors on Low Birth Weight](https://github.com/johanilagan/lbw-rstudio-analysis)
This case study investigates the relationship between low birth weight in newborns and various maternal health variables using logistic regression modeling in RStudio. The study begins with descriptive statistical analysis, followed by the construction of three logistic regression models:
- A full model including all variables (no interaction terms)
- A reduced model selected via the stepAIC() function
- A manually optimized model by eliminating statistically insignificant predictors via ANOVA
This study highlights the power of statistical modeling in identifying key maternal health risk factors and supporting data-driven healthcare decisions.
